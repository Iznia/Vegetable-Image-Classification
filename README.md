## Overview

In the agricultural industry, accurate and fast identification of vegetable types is crucial for various applications such as inventory management, marketing, and food processing. Manual identification of different types of vegetables requires significant labor and is prone to human error. Additionally, the difficulty in identifying vegetable types from images can hinder operational efficiency and increase production costs. Improving the accuracy and speed of vegetable identification through image analysis can significantly enhance efficiency and accuracy in this industry.

The dataset used in this analysis focuses on images of various types of vegetables.

## Problem Statement

In the agricultural industry, accurate and fast identification of vegetable types is very important for various applications such as inventory management, marketing, and food processing. However, manual identification of various types of vegetables requires significant labor and is prone to human error. In addition, the difficulty in identifying vegetable types from images can hinder operational efficiency and increase production costs. Improving the accuracy and speed of vegetable identification through image analysis can significantly enhance efficiency and accuracy in this industry.

To address this challenge, the company wants to develop a model capable of analyzing images to predict the type of vegetable. By creating this algorithm, the health center will be able to thoroughly analyze various aspects of patient data, such as medical history, lifestyle habits, and physiological indicators, to identify patterns and key risk factors associated with heart attacks.

## Objective

The aim of this project is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that can accurately identify vegetable types from images. This model will be used to differentiate between several categories of vegetables, using accuracy and loss as the main evaluation metrics. By applying advanced computer vision techniques, this project aims to improve the efficiency of vegetable identification, reduce human error, and enhance operations in various agricultural and food industry applications.
