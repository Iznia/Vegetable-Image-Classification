    st.markdown('''
    The goal of this project is to create a `Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)` model that accurately predicts the type of vegetable from images. It will distinguish between **Cabbage**, **Capsicum**, **Carrot**, **Cauliflower**, and **Pumpkin**, primarily using `accuracy` as the evaluation metric. This aims to improve classification accuracy and assist in various practical applications.
